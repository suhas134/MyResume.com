Image Placeholder Instructions
================================

To add a profile picture to your portfolio:

1. Find or take a professional photo (JPG, PNG, WebP)
2. Resize it to approximately 150x150 pixels (or larger)
3. Save it as "profile.jpg" in this images/ directory
4. The profile picture will automatically display on the biodata page

Image Recommendations:
- Format: JPG or PNG
- Size: 150x150 pixels minimum
- File size: Keep under 500KB for faster loading
- Quality: High quality, professional appearance
- Background: Clear, neutral background preferred

The website uses a circular crop for profile pictures, so square images work best.

Reference in HTML:
<img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Profile Picture">

Alternative image locations you might want to add:
- images/logo.png - Company/personal logo
- images/project1.jpg - Project screenshots
- images/gallery/ - Portfolio gallery images
- images/icons/ - Custom icons or illustrations

For now, the website will work without the profile image,
but visitors will see a placeholder area where the image should be.
